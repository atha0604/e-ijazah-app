# 🔒 Security Audit Report

## npm audit Results & Mitigations

**Last Audit**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: ⚠️ 2 known issues (documented & mitigated)

---

## 🚨 Known Vulnerabilities

### 1. pkg - Moderate Severity

**Package**: `pkg`
**Severity**: Moderate
**Issue**: Local Privilege Escalation (GHSA-22r3-9w55-cj54)
**Status**: ⚠️ No fix available

**Details**:
- Used only for building standalone executables
- NOT used in production runtime
- Only affects build process on developer machine

**Mitigation**:
✅ **Low Risk** - Development dependency only
- Only used during `npm run build-exe`
- Not deployed to production
- Executable build is optional feature
- Can be avoided by not using executable build

**Recommendation**:
- Continue monitoring for updates
- Consider alternative packaging tools if available
- Not critical for web deployment

### 2. xlsx - High Severity

**Package**: `xlsx` (SheetJS)
**Severity**: High
**Issues**:
- Prototype Pollution (GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6)
- Regular Expression Denial of Service - ReDoS (GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9)
**Status**: ⚠️ No fix available in current stable

**Details**:
- Used for Excel file import/export
- Processes user-uploaded files
- Potential attack vector if malicious Excel files uploaded

**Current Mitigations Implemented**:
✅ File size limits (50MB in server.js)
✅ JWT authentication required
✅ Server-side processing only
✅ No client-side Excel parsing

**Additional Mitigations Recommended**:

1. **Input Validation** ✅ (Already implemented)
   ```javascript
   // File size limit
   app.use(bodyParser.json({ limit: '50mb' }));
   ```

2. **Access Control** ✅ (Already implemented)
   - Only authenticated users can upload
   - Admin/school role required

3. **Sandboxing** (Future improvement)
   - Process Excel files in isolated environment
   - Use worker threads for parsing

4. **File Type Validation** (Can be improved)
   - Validate Excel file headers
   - Check file magic numbers

**Alternatives Considered**:
- `exceljs` - More actively maintained, but larger
- `node-xlsx` - Lighter, but less features
- Custom CSV import - Simpler, but less user-friendly

**Recommendation**:
- Monitor xlsx for security updates
- Current version (0.18.5) is latest stable
- Risk is ACCEPTABLE for current use case because:
  - Users are authenticated (not public upload)
  - Files processed server-side only
  - Used by trusted school administrators

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization ✅
- JWT-based authentication
- Token expiry (24 hours)
- Secure secret key (environment variable)
- No default credentials

### Input Validation ✅
- Parameterized SQL queries (no SQL injection)
- File size limits
- CORS whitelist
- Request body size limits

### Data Protection ✅
- Passwords hashed (bcrypt)
- JWT tokens signed
- Database foreign key constraints
- Transaction support

### Network Security ✅
- CORS configured (no wildcard)
- HTTPS recommended for production
- Credentials in environment variables

## 🔄 Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

**Weekly**:
- Run `npm audit`
- Check for security updates
- Review access logs

**Monthly**:
- Update dependencies
- Review JWT secret rotation schedule
- Check for new CVEs

**Quarterly**:
- Security audit of codebase
- Review authentication flow
- Test backup/restore procedures
- Update security documentation

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: 🟡 LOW-MEDIUM

| Component | Risk | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Authentication | 🟢 Low | Well-implemented |
| Authorization | 🟢 Low | Role-based access |
| SQL Injection | 🟢 Low | Parameterized queries |
| XSS | 🟢 Low | No dangerous innerHTML |
| CSRF | 🟢 Low | CORS configured |
| File Upload (xlsx) | 🟡 Medium | Documented vulnerability |
| Dependencies | 🟡 Medium | 2 known issues |

**Overall**: Application is reasonably secure for deployment with documented risks.

## 🚀 Deployment Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

```bash
# 1. Generate secure JWT secret
node generate-jwt-secret.js

# 2. Configure environment
# - Set strong JWT_SECRET
# - Configure CORS_ORIGINS with production domain
# - Set NODE_ENV=production

# 3. Enable HTTPS
# - Use Let's Encrypt or similar
# - Force HTTPS redirect

# 4. Add security headers
npm install helmet
# Add to server.js: app.use(helmet())

# 5. Add rate limiting
npm install express-rate-limit
# Configure per-endpoint rate limits

# 6. Backup database
# - Setup automated backups
# - Test restore procedure

# 7. Monitor logs
# - Setup error logging
# - Monitor for suspicious activity

# 8. Review environment
# - No debug mode in production
# - No console.log in production (webpack handles this)
# - Check file permissions
```

## 📞 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns privately
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow time for patch before disclosure
